Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

  curl https://raw.github.com/durdn/cfg/master/install.py -o - | python

Or in a shorter form:

  curl -Ls http://j.mp/durdncfg | python

Or:

  wget -q0 - http://j.mp/durdncfg | python

Your configuration is stored by default in ~/.cfg where it can be committed back to your git repository.
