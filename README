Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

  curl -Lks https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg/raw/master/install.sh | bash

Or in a shorter form:

  curl -Lks http://j.mp/install-cfg | bash

Or:

  wget -q0 - http://j.mp/install-cfg | sh

Your configuration is stored by default in ~/.cfg and symlinked to $HOME from
there.
