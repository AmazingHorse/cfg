Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

  curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/durdn/cfg/master/install.sh | sh

Or in a shorter form:

  curl -Lks j.mp/durdnconfig | bash

Or:

  wget -q0 - j.mp/durdnconfig | sh

Your configuration is stored by default in ~/.cfg where it can be committed back to your git repository.
