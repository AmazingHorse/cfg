Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

  curl -Lks https://bitbucket.org/durdn/cfg/raw/bc51c7dd40cf9a0e7c13f011655febedd470c56d/install.sh | bash

Or in a shorter form:
  
  curl -Lks j.mp/durdn-cfg | bash

Or:

  wget -q0 - j.mp/durdn-cfg | sh

Your configuration is stored by default in ~/.cfg where it can be committed back to your git repository.
